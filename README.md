# System Design Learning Plan

## Day-wise Schedule

### 1. Core Concepts
#### âœ… Day 1
1. What is System Design?	[link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-system-design-learn-system-design/)		
  
##### 2. System Design Strategies [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-system-design-strategy/) 
          Top-Down Design:
          Starts with a high-level view and breaks it down into smaller parts.
          Useful for planning and organizing complex systems.
          Example: Designing a website by first outlining main pages, then detailing each section.
          Bottom-Up Design:
          Begins with individual components and builds up to form the whole system.
          Useful when reusable components are available.
          Example: Building a database by first creating tables, then connecting them into a complete structure.
          Iterative Design:
          Develops the system through repeated cycles, refining with each iteration.
          Involves gathering feedback at each stage.
          Example: Releasing an app version, collecting user feedback, and improving features in each update.
          Incremental Design:
          Adds functionality in small, completed parts over time.
          Focuses on gradual expansion of system capabilities.
          Example: Building a payroll system by implementing salary calculation first, then adding tax and leave management.
          Agile Design:
          
          Flexible and iterative, adapts to changing requirements.
          Emphasizes collaboration, feedback, and quick adjustments.
          Example: Developing a social media app, adjusting features based on continuous user feedback and team input.
##### 3. High Availability vs Fault Tolerance [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/high-availability-fault-tolerance-and-disaster-recovery-explained/)		
     High Availability Systems are online as often as possible, very less downtime. its main purpose to minimize downtime.
     Fault Tolerant system works even there is any failure occurs in a system (by using standby(backup) resource.
   
#### 4. Horizontal and Vertical Scaling [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/horizontal-vs-vertical-scaling-in-database/)		
      Horizontal Scaling means adding more data resources ,easy to upgrade ,implement, limitless scaling , more cost,used when users are more than thousands.
      Vertical Scaling means increasing the capacity of the single resources,cost efficient , easy to use and implement.
